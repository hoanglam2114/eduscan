## About the Project
This project (`EXE`) was initialized by an FPT University student.  
The main purpose is to build a web/app that integrates AI to transform documents or handwriting into digital data.  

Core features include:  
- Convert scanned documents (assignments, tests, notes) into structured digital data.  
- AI-powered recognition of text, exercises, and questions.  
- Data analysis and statistics.  
- Utility personalization for students and users.  

Example use case:  
A student scans an assignment or exam → AI processes the scanned data → generates exercises or questions for practice.
